	###### * The higher your BMI result, the higher your possibilities of getting certain severe conditions, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes. 

	###### * A very low BMI can also become the cause of health problems, including bone loss, decreased immune function, and anemia.

	###### * While BMI can be helpful, it actually has limitations.

	###### * BMI may exaggerate the amount of body fat in athletes and other people with very muscular bodies. 

	###### * It may also undervalue the amount of body fat in older adults and other people who have lost muscle mass.

	###### * However, it‚Äôs useful as a first attempt to evaluate your overall health (you might not want to see a doctor yet if you‚Äôre not sure if you‚Äôre healthy or not).
